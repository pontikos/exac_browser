Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is another inherited cardiomyopathy, primarily affecting the right ventricle [Romero et al., 2013].
It is characterized clinically by fibrofatty replacement, myocardial atrophy, fibrosis, chamber dilation and aneurysm formation [Thiene et al., 1997].
ARVC affectss men three times more than women and has an overall incidence of about 1:5000 [Corrado and Thiene, 2006].
ARVC cases represent approximately 20% of the cases of SCD in the United States [Dalal et al., 2005].
The pathological presentation of ARVC is quite variable, rendering it more difficult to identify its genetic cause than well-defined diseases such as HCM.
Nevertheless, some genes have been implicated.
The desmosomal gene Desmoplakin (DSP) was found to be associated with an autosomal dominant form of ARVC [Rampazzo et al., 2002].
The finding that the genes Junction Plakoglobin (JUP) and Plakophilin 2 (PKP2) frequently contained mutations in ARVC has suggested that ARVC is a disease of cardiomyocyte junctions [McKoy et al., 2000; Tiso et al., 2001].
