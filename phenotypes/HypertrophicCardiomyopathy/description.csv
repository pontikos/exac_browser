Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiac disease, with a prevalence of 1/500 in the general population [Efthimiadis et al., 2014].
It is a myocardial form of SCD, typified by left ventricular hypertrophy [Ho, 2012] (Figure 1.1).
Such hypertrophy, when otherwise unexplained, and greater than 15mm is regarded as the main diagnostic criterion for HCM [Hickey and Rezzadeh, 2013].
Treatment of HCM includes recommendations to reduce the level of physical activity undertaken and may progress to more serious interventions such as   blockers or pacemakers.
50-60% of HCM cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion [Lopes et al., 2013b], caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomeric genes.
Z-disc and calcium handling genes are also associated with HCM, but are thought to explain <1% of cases.
The sarcomere is the basic unit of muscle that is comprised of myosin thick filaments and actin thin filaments arranged longitudinally [Rahimov and Kunkel, 2013].
The Myosin Heavy Chain (MYHC) gene on chromosome 14q1 alone counts for â‡  30 to 50 % of cases, followed by Myosin Binding Protein Cardiac 3 (MYBPC3).
HCM is characterised by a variable phenotype and incomplete penetrance.
As a result of this, family screening of patients with HCM is vital for effective disease managment, while also offering the potential to elucidate the genetic basis.
